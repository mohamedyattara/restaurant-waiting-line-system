# restaurant-waiting-line-system

## Project Overview
This Java application simulates managing a restaurant's waiting line efficiently.  
It uses a PriorityQueue-based system to determine which customer should be served next, prioritizing based on arrival time and customer priority.  
The system is designed using object-oriented principles and models a realistic scenario with dynamically arriving customers.

## Features
- Efficient PriorityQueue-based queue to manage customers
- Dynamic updates for customers arriving at different times
- Customer prioritization reduces selection from linear scanning to O(log n)
- Modular class structure for easy maintenance and future extensions

## Tech Stack
- Language: Java
- Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Priority Queues
- Tools: Eclipse, Git, GitHub
